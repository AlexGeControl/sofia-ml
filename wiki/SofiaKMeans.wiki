#summary Documentation for sofia-kmeans.

= Introduction =

The `sofia-kmeans` package allows k-means clustering on large scale data.  Options are included for using both random cluster initialization and the k-means++ algorithm for cluster seeding.  There are optimization methods for batch k-means (Lloyd's classic kmeans algorithm), Bottou and Bengio's online k-means variant (sgd k-means), and a very fast mini-batch stochastic gradient descent method for large scale data sets.

== Command line flag options: == 

  * *--L1_epsilon*  When set to a positive value, we use an approximate L1 projection rather than an exact L1 projection.  The projection results in each center lying within a ball with L1 radius of between --L1_lambda and (1 + --L1_epsilon) `*` --L1_lambda.
    Default is to peform exact projection.

  * *--L1_lambda* When set to a positive value, forces each cluster center to lie within a ball with L1 radius at most --L1_lambda.
    Default is not to enforce this constraint.

  * *--buffer_mb* Size of buffer to use in reading/writing to files, in MB. 
    Default: 40

  * *--cluster_assignments_out*  Assign each example in the --test_file to its closest cluster center, and write these results to this file.  Format of the  file is <nearest center id>TAB<true label (if any)>.
    Default: no output file.

  * *--cluster_mapping_out*  Transform each vector in --test_file by mapping it onto the set of cluster centers.  Each example x is mapped to a new transformed vector x', where each coordinate i (ranging from  1..k+1) of  x' corresponds to cluster_center  i-1. The value of coordinate i is given by f(x, c(i-1))  where f is --cluster_mapping_type.
    Default: no mapping output file.

  * *--cluster_mapping_param* The parameter value to use in --cluster_mapping_out.  
    Default is: 1.0.

  *--cluster_mapping_type*  The mapping function to use to create the --cluster_mapping_out file.  The value p is given by --cluster_mapping_param.
    Options are:
      squared_distance        f(x, c) = `|``|``x - c`|``|` ^ 2
      rbf_kernel              f(x, c) = exp(-p `*` `|``|`x - c`|``|` ^ 2)
    Default: squared_distance

  *--dimensionality*      Index value of largest feature index in training data set. 
    Default: 2^17 = 131072

      --init_type           Initialization procedure for seeding the kmeans optimization.
    Options are:
      random          random selection of cluster centers
      kmeans_pp       kmeans++ initialization method (naive)
      optimized_kmeans_pp   optimized kmeans++
    Default: random

      --iterations          Number of optimization steps to take.
    Default: 100000

      --k                   The number of cluster centers to find.  Must be set.


      --mini_batch_size     When using mini_batch_kmeans, the number of examples to sample on each round.
    Default: 100

      --model_in            Read in a model from this file.

      --model_out           Write the model to this file.

      --no_bias_term        When set, causes a bias term x_0 to be set to 0 for every 
    feature vector loaded from files, rather than the default 
    of x_0 = 1.
    Default: set.

      --objective_after_init  Compute value of the kmeans objective function on training data,
    after initializing the cluster centers.
    Default is not to do this.

      --objective_after_training  Compute value of the kmeans objective function on training data,
    after completing training the cluster centers.
    Default is not to do this.

      --objective_on_test   Compute value of the kmeans objective function on test data.
    Default is not to do this.

      --opt_type            Optimization procedure for kmeans objective.
    Options are: batch_kmeans, sgd_kmeans, mini_batch_kmeans
     Default: sgd_kmeans

      --random_seed         When set to non-zero value, use this seed instead of seed 
    from system clock. This can be useful for parameter tuning 
    in cross-validation, as setting a fixed seed by hand forces 
    examples to be sampled in the same order.  However
    for actual training/test, this should never be used.
    Default: 0

      --sample_size         When using sampling_kmeans_pp, the number of examples to sample on each round.
    Default: 1000

      --test_file           File to be used for testing.

      --training_file       File to be used for training.
